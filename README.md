## Hasura Summer Internship Task.

### For the selection of Internship at the company I was assigned a task which was - 

  - To build and deploy a simple ToDo application using Flutter with backend powered by Hasura GraphQL engine.
  - Using auth0/firebase authentication for signup in the application.
  - Deploying Hasura on Heroku.
  - Writing up a small blog post/ReadMe about how I went to approach the task.
  - Deploy the whole project on Github and use version control as well.
  
  ### So to accomplish the whole task I decided to divide the whole into small parts and try to execute them as a whole.
  
  ## Task 1 - Flutter 
  
 Since almost all of the technology and Although I did was familiar with what Flutter was and how was it getting better everyday I did not use it untill today when I was given the task to.
  
  I had a different approach on tackling this
  - I went to the internet and searched about the similarities and the differences between the normal iOS App Development(Since I am an iOS Developer) and Flutter and Hybrid App Development.
  
    Searching all of this I got to know about a really cool feature known as Hot Reload and I was very amazed with it and definitely wanted to try.
    
So I went to the official [Flutter's website](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/install/macos) to see how to proceed
Inside Docs there was Installation guide for MacOS.

It had the following task -
 - Get the Flutter SDK.
 - Unzip the SDK at any Directory.
 - Add the path to your Editor.
 
 I was it was the setup on the individual environment and as I prefer [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) more [this](https://flutter.io/docs/development/tools/vs-code) documentaion helped me 
 more.
 It has the following task - 
 - Install the plugins named as "Flutter" and "Dart" and after Installing just reload the editor.
 - Creating a new project-
      1. Press (Cmd+Shift+P) for Mac or (Ctrl+Shift+P) for Windows to open up the Command Palette.
      2. Select Flutter New project and select enter.
      3. Enter the name of the project(*this will be the name of the final app also*) and then save it in the desired directory.
 - Write Code to create the app.
 - Debug and see the errors and problems.
